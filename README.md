PROJECT CONCEPT

The idea of the project is to create a smart environment (ecosystem) for entrepreneurs that would provide them with customized support and guidance to boost their productivity and maintain their physical health and emotional equilibrium.

The ecosystem obtains information about the physical and emotional state of an entrepreneur by pooling data from a variety of devices:
• a watch that monitors blood pressure, heart pulse and body temperature;
• a headband that registers brain activity, blood oxygen level and hydration level;
• emotional recognition and movement detection sensors installed in the working area.

The collected data is then automatically analysed by an application that suggests various activities based on the current emotional and physical state of a person as well as on preset goals selected by the entrepreneur. In order to personalize the experience, the recommendations are formulated by an AI coach.

For example, if the system detects that a person is tired, it might suggest a meditation or a power nap. If the system detects that a person entered their most productive state, the system suggests working on the most important task of the day. After the entrepreneur selects one of the suggested activities, the system automatically adjusts the environment (it adjusts the lighting and room temperature, mutes email and text notifications, switches on soothing music) to optimize the environment in support of the selected activity.
